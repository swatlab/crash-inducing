Also, roc's patch in\nbug 839270 added a bunch of NOPS before that line which did seem to help\n(at least for that particular build):\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/23f455023faf\n\nI don't see a reason to keep this bug hidden / sec-high.  We already have\na dozen or so crash bugs with \"AMD Radeon\" in the subject that are public\nso I think we can open this one too (if we hide comments with URLs).\nI don't see anything more sensitive here compared to the other bugs."},{"is_private":false,"attachment_id":null,"creator":"dveditz@mozilla.com","time":"2013-04-08T19:29:23Z","author":"dveditz@mozilla.com","bug_id":714320,"tags":[],"text":"OK.","id":7290408,"creation_time":"2013-04-08T19:29:23Z","raw_text":"OK."},{"is_private":false,"attachment_id":null,"creator":"scoobidiver@netcourrier.com","time":"2013-05-12T14:17:57Z","author":"scoobidiver@netcourrier.com","bug_id":714320,"tags":[],"text":"22.0a2/20130511 is a bad build.","id":7413608,"creation_time":"2013-05-12T14:17:57Z","raw_text":"22.0a2/20130511 is a bad build."},{"is_private":false,"attachment_id":null,"creator":"kairo@kairo.at","time":"2013-05-13T00:47:14Z","author":"kairo@kairo.at","bug_id":714320,"tags":[],"text":"Let's not pollute the topcrash list with what we know is a single bad Aurora build, please.
